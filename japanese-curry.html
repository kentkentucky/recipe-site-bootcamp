        <h1>Japanese Curry Rice</h1>
        <img src="./images/japanese curry rice.jpg">
        <p>Japanese Curry Rice (カレーライス, Kare Raisu) is a beloved comfort dish in Japan, characterized by its rich, savory curry sauce served over steamed rice. Unlike the spicier curries found in India or Thailand, Japanese curry has a milder, slightly sweet flavor, often thickened with a roux made from flour and butter. The dish typically includes ingredients like tender pieces of meat (usually chicken, beef, or pork), potatoes, carrots, and onions, making it hearty and satisfying.</p>
        <p>Japanese curry rice became popular in the late 19th century after being introduced by the British, who had adopted curry during their time in India. Over time, it evolved to suit Japanese palates, with various regional twists and adaptations. Today, it’s a staple in homes and restaurants across the country, often served with pickled vegetables (fukujinzuke) on the side for a tangy contrast. Easy to prepare and endlessly customizable, Japanese curry rice is a true representation of Japan’s ability to transform foreign cuisine into something uniquely its own.</p>
